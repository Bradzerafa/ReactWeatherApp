# Weather-App
This project is a basic weather application created to practice learning ReactJS. The weather is shown by searching for a location and then that location is queried to Open weathers API. 

The design of this app will remain simple as the project was focused on the understanding and functionality of React. 

Open weather: https://openweathermap.org/

<b> NOTE: To use this app, you must put an API key at the start of the App.JS file. </b>
